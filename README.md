## Backend API Implementation using Node and Express JS

### Tasks

1. Create a simple Express.js server with three endpoints:

    - GET request to fetch an object by ID.
    - POST request to add a new object.
    - DELETE request to delete an object by ID.

2. Log all requests to the backend.

3. Validate the requests for adding and deleting objects.

4. Create simple unit tests using Jest or another testing framework.

5. Implement dependency injection for handling object processing.

**Bonus:** Deploy the API to a cloud provider (e.g., Vercel, Heroku).
